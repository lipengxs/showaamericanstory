## An Unprecedented Post-Apocalyptic World

Imagine if history had taken a different turn. Showa 66. Japan, with its formidable economic power, has bought out most of the United States.

The two cultures rapidly meld together, and although conflicts are inevitable, citizens gradually adapt to a life they never could have imagined.
